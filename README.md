# AOC_2025
Puzzles from Advent of Code 2025 (Solved in C++)

## Compiling:

Run:
```bash
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja && cmake --build build/
```

After compilation every puzzle should be their separate binary.
Provide it an input data with "-i" flag, e.g.:
```bash
# in ./day2/
./../build/day2/VaultLock -i InputData.txt
```
